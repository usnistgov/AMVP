# AMVP

Industry/NIST Collaboration on the development of an Automated Cryptographic Module Validation Protocol (AMVP).

# Background

The plethora of cryptographic module validations has proven to outstrip available human resources for Vendors, Labs and Validators alike. Driven by government regulation and customer demand, vendors are pursuing validation for an increasingly larger number of cryptographic modules. Despite their technical acumen, rapid changes in technology and its steep learning curve is stretching the resources at Certified Testing Labs. When evaluation package submissions finally reach the validation queue, inconsistent and possibly incomplete evidence presentation further strains the ability for a finite number of Validators to provide timely turnaround.

# Objective

All these challenges point to a dire need for consistent and reproducible evidence generation, reporting, and processing of cryptographic module validations. To achieve consistency, all parties must follow an agreed standard or protocol for identifying the implementation under test, references to all prerequisites, and evidence proving implementation meets standardized requirements. The objective would be to define a protocol allowing independent implementation by all stakeholders for accelerated evidence generation, submission, and validation of cryptographic modules.

# Project Goals

The development of an Automated Module Validation Protocol (AMVP) would enable the generation and validation of standardized evaluation evidence from the Operational Testing of an Implementation Under Test (IUT). Associating the AMVP evidence with cryptographic algorithm evidence produced using the Automated Cryptography Validation Protocol (ACVP) would enable the complete and verifiable representation of an IUT. Leveraging an Automated Validation Protocol (AVP) would ensure consistent, reproducible, and timely validations of an IUT with the Authoritative Validation System (AVS).
