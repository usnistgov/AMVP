# AMVP
Industry/NIST Collaboration on the development of an Automated Cryptographic Module Validation Protocol (AMVP).
# Background
The plethora of cryptographic module validations has proven to outstrip available human resources for Vendors, 
Labs and Validators alike. Driven by government regulation and customer demand, vendors are pursuing 
validation for an increasingly larger number of cryptographic modules. Despite their technical acumen, rapid 
changes in technology and its steep learning curve is stretching the resources at Certified Testing Labs. When 
evaluation package submissions finally reach the validation queue, inconsistent and possibly incomplete evidence 
presentation further strains the ability for a finite number of Validators to provide timely turnaround. See the NIST [Automated Cryptographic Validation Testing project](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Automated-Cryptographic-Validation-Testing) for broader context and information. 
# Objective
All these challenges point to a dire need for consistent and reproducible evidence generation, reporting, and 
processing of cryptographic module validations. To achieve consistency, all parties must follow an agreed 
standard or protocol for identifying the implementation under test, references to all prerequisites, and evidence 
proving implementation meets standardized requirements. The objective would be to define a protocol allowing 
independent implementation by all stakeholders for accelerated evidence generation, submission, and validation 
of cryptographic modules.
# Project Goals
The development of an Automated Module Validation Protocol (AMVP) would enable the generation and 
validation of standardized evaluation evidence from the Operational Testing of an Implementation Under Test 
(IUT). Associating the AMVP evidence with cryptographic algorithm evidence produced using the Automated 
Cryptography Validation Protocol (ACVP) would enable the complete and verifiable representation of an IUT. 
Leveraging an Automated Validation Protocol (AVP) would ensure consistent, reproducible, and timely 
validations of an IUT with the Authoritative Validation System (AVS).
